# Keybroad II

Keybroad is a tiny app that starts up with your Mac and helps you type faster and more comfortable. It also automatically formats your text the way typography nerds do.

## The Double-Space

You've already seen KB's key feature on your iPhone and iPad: press the `SPACE` button twice to type `DOT+SPACE` after the last word you've entered. This little improvement helps to unify the experiences and switch from typing on iPhone or iPad to your Mac seamlessly. Auto-capitalization included.

## Typographer

## Useful CapsLock button<sup>*</sup>

CapsLock is useless, everybody knows it. But it's also the only button with personal light indicator, which is helpful in case you need to display current status of something. Keyboard layout for instance. Easily set up layouts you wish to switch and get one-button hardware-indicated switcher.

<sup>*</sup>Option will be available for users with two or more input sources added in OS settings.
